# In virtual environments, we can define environment variables! To do so, type:
# "export VARIABLE_NAME=value" (or "set VARIABLE_NAME=value" in Windows Command Prompt), 
# like with variables in .env files.

#     app.run(port=5001,debug=True) # Will eventually remove debug=True and the app.run line once this is ready for deployment
